# üóÉÔ∏è Filecheck github action
A simple GitHub action to check the list of files on a pull request.

## Inspiration
I have been reading the submission blogs for this year's GitHub Actions Hackathon. Also, most of the opensource repos on GitHub actively use GitHub actions to automate the workflow efficiently. Thus, I thought of building one and learning how about use them.

## What it does
Checks the list the files in the repository on a pull request.

## How I built it
- Created a repo on GitHub.
- Formed a `.github/workflows` directory.
- Made a `.yml` file of the workflow.

## Challenges I ran into
- Choosing a learning resource (chose the official docs)

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learned about GitHub actions by building one.

## What I learned
- How to automate things with GitHub actions.
- Worked with YAML files
